## Why Continued SEO Investment Matters

**SEO is not a one-time project** - it's an ongoing process. Here's why:

1. **Algorithm Updates:** Google updates its algorithm 500+ times per year. Monitoring ensures you stay compliant.
2. **Competitor Activity:** Other law firms are actively optimizing. Standing still means falling behind.
3. **Content Freshness:** Google favors recently updated, comprehensive content.
4. **Technical Debt:** Websites accumulate technical issues over time that impact rankings.
5. **ROI Optimization:** Without conversion tracking and optimization, you're leaving money on the table.

**Expected ROI Timeline:**
- **Months 1-3:** Foundation building, indexing, initial ranking improvements
- **Months 4-6:** Significant ranking improvements, increased organic traffic
- **Months 7-12:** Established authority, consistent lead flow from organic search
- **Year 2+:** Compounding returns, dominant positions for target keywords
